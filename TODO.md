# TODO

* [ ] Add "Reindent to Settings" option that will change indentation to match
      the settings for the file (i.e. if you change from 2 to 4 spaces, this
      would allow you to reindent to 4 spaces).
* [ ] Add support for reading .editorconfig for automatically enabling or
      disabling.
